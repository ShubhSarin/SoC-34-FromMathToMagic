This repository is the complete guide and codebase for a 13‑week journey from the math of randomness to a working text‑to‑image diffusion model — built entirely by you, from scratch. No black boxes, no pre‑built pipelines, no API wrappers.

By Week 12, when someone asks you how DALL‑E or Stable Diffusion works, you won’t have to look it up. You’ll have written it.

**No GPU required.** Free cloud compute (Google Colab) is enough for the whole project.

## 🏆 What You'll Build

A **text‑to‑image diffusion model** — your own mini Stable Diffusion.

Feed it a prompt like `"a dog on the moon"` or `"the digit 3"`. Watch it generate matching images starting from pure random noise. You will implement all three core pillars:

- **Variational Autoencoder (VAE)** – compresses images into a compact latent space
- **Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM)** – learns to reverse the noise process
- **CLIP text conditioning** – makes the model listen to your words

Every component is written, trained, and understood by you. No copying. No wrappers.

## 🗺️ The Journey — 5 Milestones

The project is a **single growing codebase**, not isolated assignments. Each week you extend what you built before.

| Milestone | Week | What you'll achieve |
|-----------|------|----------------------|
| **1** | 3 | First generative model – linear VAE on 2D synthetic data |
| **2** | 6 | Face VAE – morphing GIFs, latent space arithmetic on 200K faces |
| **3** | 8 | Forward diffusion – destroy images with controlled noise (T=1000) |
| **4** | 10 | Unconditional DDPM – generate MNIST & CIFAR‑10 from pure noise |
| **5** | 12 | **Text‑to‑image** – final project with CLIP conditioning |

| 3 | **Milestone 1** – linear VAE on 2D data | Latent space plots |
| 4 | Convolutional VAE on MNIST | Sharper reconstructions |
| 5 | VAE on CelebA (200K faces) | Trained face model |
| 6 | **Milestone 2** – latent space surgery | Face interpolation GIF |
| 7 | Mathematics of noise (schedules, closed‑form) | Noise schedule implementation |
| 8 | **Milestone 3** – forward diffusion pipeline | Visualisation x₀ → x_T |
| 9 | Build the denoiser (UNet from scratch) | UNet with time embeddings |
| 10 | **Milestone 4** – unconditional DDPM | Samples from noise (MNIST, CIFAR) |
| 11 | Conditional generation (class labels + CFG) | “Generate a 7” |
| 12 | **Milestone 5** – text‑to‑image with CLIP | Final project done |

**Total effort:** ~150 hours across 13 weeks.

## ✅ Prerequisites (No Math Background Required)

You don't need a degree in probability or linear algebra. We teach the math as we go, from the ground up.  
What you **do** need:

- **Basic programming** – writing functions, loops, using lists. That’s it.
- **Willingness to learn** – we cover everything else in Week 0 and Week 1.

All necessary probability (Gaussians, Bayes, KL divergence) is introduced with visual, beginner‑friendly resources before you write a single line of generative code.

> If you can install Python and run `print("hello world")`, you're ready.

## 💻 Compute

No personal GPU needed. All training runs on free cloud services:

- **Google Colab (free tier)** – T4 GPU, ~12 hour sessions – primary platform
- **Kaggle Notebooks** – P100 GPU, 30 hours/week free – backup

CPU is fine for Weeks 0–4. GPU becomes useful from Week 5 onward.
